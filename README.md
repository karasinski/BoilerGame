BoilerGame
======

This is my attempt at writing a readable example of a complete HTML5 game using the Phaser framework.

The easiest way to get this running is currently:
```bash
$ npm install http-server -g
$ cd BoilerGame
$ http-server
```

You can then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your favorite web browser.
